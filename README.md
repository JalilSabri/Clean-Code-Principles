# Clean-Code-Principles
The target of this post is clean code principles, and other cases investigated in other posts, so some below topics maybe aren't standard or in best practice:
Implementation Layers, Implementation Architecture, Business Logic
Business workflow, even performance, ...

instead of it, I focused on these topics:
1.Naming
2.SOLID
3.Method Chaining
4.Minimal use of comments
5.Error handling with Polymorphism
6.Avoid Type-Checking
7.Enumeration
8.Side Effects
9.Interpolated Strings And In-line if
10.Code Optimization(Null Coalescing, Expression Body Methods, Switch, ...)
...
